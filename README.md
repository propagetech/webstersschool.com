## webstersschool.com – HTML pages with no references (orphans)

These pages are not linked from any other file in the project (no `href` to them). They may be intentional (e.g. error page, legacy) or candidates to add to the main nav.

| Page                             | Note                                         |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **404.html**                     | Error page; served on 404, not linked in nav |
| **Downloads.html**               | No `href` from any other file                |
| **future-developments.html**     | No `href` from any other file                |
| **student-life-facilities.html** | No `href` from any other file                |
| **home-old.html**                | No `href` (legacy/backup page)               |
| **secretary.html**               | No `href` from any other file                |
| **school-prayer.html**           | No `href` from any other file                |
| **newsandevents.html**           | No `href` from any other file                |
| **alumni.html**                  | No `href` from any other file                |
| **nursery.html**                 | No `href` from any other file                |
| **juniormiddle-school.html**     | No `href` from any other file                |

**Total: 11 pages** with no references in the project.

_index.html_ is reached via `href="/index.html"` from every page, so it is not an orphan.
